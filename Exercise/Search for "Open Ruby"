returns the value of the block.

If path starts with a pipe character ("|"), a subprocess is created, connected
to the caller by a pair of pipes.  The returned IO object may be used to write
to the standard input and read from the standard output of this subprocess.

If the command following the pipe is a single minus sign ("|-"), Ruby forks,
and this subprocess is connected to the parent.  If the command is not "-",
the subprocess runs the command.

When the subprocess is Ruby (opened via "|-"), the open call returns nil.  If
a block is associated with the open call, that block will run twice --- once
in the parent and once in the child.

The block parameter will be an IO object in the parent and nil in the child.
The parent's IO object will be connected to the child's $stdin and $stdout.
The subprocess will be terminated at the end of the block.
